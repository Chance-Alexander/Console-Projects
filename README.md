# MyRoulette-ConsoleApp
A minor project completed in a console application, intended to simulate the outcomes of roulette tables. NOTE: The meat of the program is located within a .dll within the debug folder.
This project simulates a roulette table, in which you can bet on. You will have $1000 to start, and ten turns to win or lose it all.
Upon conclusion of the ten turns, you will recieve a prompt that the game is complete, although you may continue if "Yes" is selected.
